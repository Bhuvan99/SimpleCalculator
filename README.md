# SimpleCalculator
From Bhuvan J J
# Assignment

Let's learn day to day git commands and concepts by building a simple calculator application using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Bootstrap4.
If you don't know HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap4 don't worry. This repo has all the code that is required to build the application. You just need to copy paste the code for respective branches from this template repo in order to complete this assignment.

## Goal of this assignment is to make you learn:
- [x] Creating Github account & configuring SSH key 
- [x] Creating new local git repository from sratch 
- [x] Linking local repo to the remote github repo 
- [x] Working with feature branches 
- [x] Setting upstream branches
- [x] Raising pull requests 
- [x] Using pull requests for doing code reviews 
- [x] Merging of branches on remote repo
- [x] Pulling latest changes from the remote repo
- [x] Resolving merge conflicts
- [x] Tagging source code for the release
- [x] Learn day to day git commands vit git command line interface


## Pay attention to the following points:
1.	Make sure name of your repo in Github is “SimpleCalculator”. Don't use some other name. Pay attention to the case sensitivity
2.	Make sure your repo has following branches ('feature/' suffix is mandatory for each of the feature branches):
   - master
   - develop
   - feature/header
   - feature/footer
   - feature/add
   - feature/subtract
   - feature/multiply
   - feature/divide
3.	Make sure commit messages matches with the respective message in the below mentioned steps
4.	Number of pull requests in your repo must match with this template repo. Also the pull request content must also match
5.	Content of latest commit in each of your feature, develop and master branch must match with the respective branches in this repo
6.	Number of commitsin each of your feature, develop and master branch must match with the respective branches in this repo

#### Note:
Make your repo public. Submitted assignments will be evaluated through a script and not adhering to the above mentioned guidelines will lead you to fail in the test. 

Your completed assignment should look exactly same as this repo except the README file.

#### Tagging code on master branch for the release
52.	Create an annotated tag with name “v1.0” and message “First version of SimpleCalulator app with add, subtract, multiply and divide features”
#### Note: Tag has to be annotated tag not a lightweight tag
53.	Push the tag to the remote repo


## Steps for resolving merge conflict:
Suppose there is a merge conflict in one of the feature branch then you need to follow below mentioned steps for resolving the merge conflict:

1. Checkout to develop branch using (assuming develop branch is the target branch for the pull request)
2. Execute “git pull” to update your local develop branch (assuming develop branch is setup to track origin/develop)
3. Switch to the feature branch 
4. Merge develop branch changes to the feature branch via “git merge develop”
5. Resolve all the merge conflicts by opening the files having conflict in your favourtie editor
6. Stage all the resolved files via “git add <file-name>” 
7. Complete the merge by commiting the staged changes git commit -m “Commit message” 
8. Push the merged changes to the corresponding remote feature branch via “git push” (assuming upstream branch has been already setup for your local feature branch)
9. Merge the pull request in remote github repo
